Note that testing and debugging might require additional settings like enabling the Developer Mode in Chrome. Please do your research before enabling any advanced mode.

To test your local clone after any changes, here is a guide for firefox and chrome:

## Firefox

1. Type `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` into your url box.
2. Click on "Load Temporary Add-on".
3. Select the *Zip* file containing the code (simply zip the folder you clone).
After that, the extention is ready for debugging!

## Chrome
1. Type `chrome://extensions` into your url box.
2. Enable Developer mode.
3. Click "Load unpacked".
4. Select the *folder* containing the code.
The extention will be added right away to your list!
